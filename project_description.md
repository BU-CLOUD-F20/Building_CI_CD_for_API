Project Overview:
Background: In this project, the students will build a simple API with python and flask that will be developed, tested, verified, deployed (to user acceptance testing or staging env), verified (again), and promoted to production environment (deployed to production) in an automated manner (Continuous Integration / Continuous Delivery) using the DevOps principles.
 
Project Specifics: In this project, the students will build a simple API with python and flask that will be developed, tested, verified, deployed (to user acceptance testing or staging env), verified (again), and promoted to production environment (deployed to production) in an automated manner (Continuous Integration / Continuous Delivery) using the DevOps principles. 

The developed codes will be kept in Git for source control management, we will automate the builds for the python code via <YOU-WILL-DECIDE>, we will use the <YOU-WILL-DECIDE â€“ e.g. Apache?> web application server to serve the APIs on an interactive interface, we will test our codes with Pytest, we will potentially use docker to host our applications and package them and we will use Ansible to perform the necessary additional configurations that we cannot package into docker. We will try to make use of the OpenShift and/or K8s features to do deployments with zero downtime.

Some Technologies you will learn/use:
Agile methods
DevOps
CI/CD
PyTest
